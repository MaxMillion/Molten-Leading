# Slingin’ Hot Leading
Manually adjusting ```line-height``` for optimum readability across a bunch of media queries is kind of a pain. So I made a thing.

## Notes:
* Binding to ```resize``` makes me nauseous to begin with, and in this first pass I’m going about it in a particularly gross way.
* There’s a demo <a href="http://wilto.github.com/Molten-Leading/">right hurr</a>.

(I’m kinda bad at readmes.)
